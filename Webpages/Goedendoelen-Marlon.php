    <p>Team Trees is a global environmental project launched by YouTuber MrBeast (Jimmy Donaldson) and Mark Rober, a former NASA engineer. The goal of Team Trees is to plant 20 million trees worldwide.

     The initiative began when MrBeast uploaded a video on his YouTube channel titled "I Planted 20,000,000 Trees." In this video, he called on his viewers to contribute to tree planting by donating money to the Arbor Day Foundation. For every $1 donation, he pledged to plant a tree. The Arbor Day Foundation is a non-profit organization focusing on tree planting projects and environmental conservation.</p>

     <p>This campaign quickly went viral and garnered support from numerous celebrities, influencers, and businesses. The aim was not only to raise awareness about the importance of forest conservation and the fight against climate change but also to take concrete action by planting trees.</p>

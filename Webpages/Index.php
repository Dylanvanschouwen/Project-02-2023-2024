    <h1>Donate to play</h1>
    <p>"Donate to play" is a phrase that can be used in the context of fundraising or charitable initiatives related to gaming or online content creation. It typically refers to a scenario where individuals or viewers can make a donation to a cause or charity in exchange for the opportunity to play a game or participate in an event.

For example, a streamer on a platform like Twitch might organize a charity livestream where viewers can donate to a chosen charity. In return, the donors may have the chance to play a game with the streamer, receive special in-game items, or participate in other interactive activities during the stream.

The idea is to encourage donations by offering some form of engagement or interaction as a reward. This approach is often used by content creators to leverage their platform and audience for charitable causes, making the act of donating more engaging and enjoyable for the contributors.</p>
